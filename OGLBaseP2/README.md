Name: Matthew Bosio

I chose to make a Minecraft scene. My scene depicts a creeper sneaking up on Steve, the main character, while he is sniffing a flower. Minecraft is my favorite video game, and it is the reason I became interested in computers and eventually Computer Science. I also think that the graphical style of Minecraft, voxels, are extremely cool. I think that positioning and scaling both Steve and the creeper correctly shows I have mastered transforms. Steve is the multishape mesh. He consists of his head, torso, legs, and arms.

Finding obj files was more difficult than I thought it'd be. First, I thought I would have trouble finding Miencraft obj files since it is a licensed game. But there was a ton of free assets out there, so that wasn't the issue. The issue was finding a rigged steve so that I could animate seperate parts of his body differently. 

I think that popular media was definitely easier to find assets on. If I wanted something specific that wasn't well known, there was a very slim chance that I'd be able to find a obj for it, much less a free one.
